Thank you for visiting this page!

To express my appreciation, please let me tell some short stories. Hope you like them.
 
### About Me (and Where to Find Me)  

My [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizhenbo/) shows my education and work experience. My information on LinkedIn is true, official but boring. I've moved to <a rel="me" href="https://fediscience.org/@zhenboli">Mastodon</a>, please follow `@zhenboli@fediscience.org`

### Featured Projects
I proudly share these open-source projects created by me:  

#### [fireSeqSearch](https://github.com/Endle/fireSeqSearch)  
It is inspired by Evernote's browser extension - if we search a term, for example, softmax in Google, fireSeqSearch will also search in our personal notebook, and append the hits into Google results.

Obviously, I ❤ [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/), and I believe it is the best note-taking software. [Here is why (In Chinese)](https://cha.fan/questions/7ZJCLaCKHQYtPGuwFT2F)  

#### [rust-bundler-cp](https://github.com/Endle/rust-bundler-cp)  
It creates a single-source-file version of a Cargo package. It's designed for Competitive Programming like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Although my rating is dropping, I still love competitive programming, and I would attend some contests if I have time.  

Now you know that I ❤ Rust. Yes, I believe some programming languages are better than others, and Rust is a Tier 0 PL.

I've created a toy language, [ironCamel](https://github.com/Endle/ironCamel), which intends to be the "most functional" imperative programming language. Its intepreter is written in Rust.

#### Dota

I've been playing Dota since 6.59, when Tinker could refresh BKB. I had to admit that I'm a bad player.
